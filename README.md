##  Business Case / Task at Hand

What are we going to be doing on this project? What's the scenario? What specific insights are we looking for from our models? What are some of the challenges  we moight face?<br>

## Data Sources

## Python Libraries
The imported libraries listed below were essential to the project's workflow:
###### Data Cleaning & Vizualizing
Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy allowed for the standard data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization procedures. 
- `import pandas as pd`
- `import numpy as np`
- `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- `import seaborn as sns`
###### Modeling
All models and performance metrics were called from the `sklearn` library
- `from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier`
- `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`
- `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`
- `from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier`
